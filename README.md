# Bank-System
A fully functional bank system.

Purpose: I wanted to create a fun project to work on and to practice programming (OO design and building real applications).

## Features
A customer can login/sign up, create their own accounts, deposit, withdraw, transfer, check details and view all transactions for that account.

The admin has access to all customer's credentials, the admin can delete or view that customer's account, the admin can delete that account or view that account's transactions.

Finally, all customers and accounts data are stored in a .txt format so that when the app is reopened, the data still exists.
